  <p class="news_content">Monster Energy has announced that it is expanding its partnership with Professional Bull Riders, a 25-year-old organization with more than 600 members.

The energy drink brand, which has sponsored the organization’s riders and events since 2011, will now have the primary marketing rights to its 25th anniversary tour, ‘Unleash The Beast.’ The two will officially kick off the partnership at the ‘Monster Energy Buck Off’ event at Madison Square Garden this weekend in New York City.

“Monster Energy and its ‘unleash the beast’ mentality are the perfect complement to a sport that has been unleashing bovine beasts in arenas across the country for 25 years,” added Sean Gleason, chief executive of PBR. “We are proud to expand our relationship with the bold, exuberant, risk-taking brand that has been a long-time supporter of our great bull riders and animal athletes as we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the toughest sport on dirt.”
